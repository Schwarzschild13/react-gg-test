- Good tooling and documentation for both
- Flexible data fetching for different client needs
- Easy to cache and optimize

## DevOps and Infrastructure

### Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes or Serverless

**Recommendation**: Docker containers with Kubernetes for full control, or serverless for simplicity.

**Docker/Kubernetes Advantages**:

- Industry-standard practices
- Cost-effective for high traffic

**Serverless Advantages**:
- Simplified deployment and scaling
- Pay-per-use pricing model
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Good for getting started quickly
- Less infrastructure management

### CI/CD: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

**Recommendation**: GitHub Actions for GitHub-hosted projects, GitLab CI for GitLab.

**Rationale**:
- Integrated with source control
- Good free tier for open source projects
- Extensive marketplace of actions
- Easy to set up and maintain
- Good documentation and community support

### Monitoring: Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

**Recommendation**: Sentry for error tracking, DataDog or New Relic for performance monitoring.

**Rationale**:
- Real-time error tracking and alerting
- Performance insights and optimization recommendations
- User experience monitoring
- Integration with deployment pipelines
- Good free tiers for getting started

## Security Considerations

### Authentication: Auth0 or Firebase Auth

**Recommendation**: Auth0 for enterprise features, Firebase Auth for simplicity.

**Rationale**:
- Handles complex authentication flows
- Social login integration
- Multi-factor authentication support
- Compliance with security standards
- Reduces security implementation burden

### Code Execution Security

**Recommendation**: Multi-layered security with Docker, resource limits, and network isolation.

**Security Measures**:
- Docker containers with minimal base images
- CPU and memory limits per execution
- Network isolation to prevent external access
- Timeout limits for long-running code
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging for all executions

## Scalability Architecture

### Microservices vs Monolith

**Recommendation**: Start with modular monolith, evolve to microservices as needed.

**Rationale**:
- Simpler to develop and deploy initially
- Easier to maintain with small teams
- Can extract services as bottlenecks emerge
- Reduces operational complexity
- Good performance for most use cases

### Caching Strategy

**Recommendation**: Multi-level caching with CDN, application cache, and database cache.

**Caching Layers**:
- CDN for static assets and API responses
- Redis for session data and frequently accessed content
- Database query result caching
